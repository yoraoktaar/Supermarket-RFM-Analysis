## Business Understanding

<span style="font-size:20px; font-family: monospace;">`1. Background`</span>

In facing increasingly intense competition in the supermarket retail industry, companies need to deeply understand customer segmentation. The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) method is an appropriate approach for analyzing the time of the last purchase, transaction frequency, and the total purchase value of customers. By analyzing customer data from 2012 to 2014 and comparing the effectiveness between customer segments and their responses to marketing campaigns, companies can develop more accurate promotional strategies to enhance loyalty and increase sales.

### What is RFM?

RFM stands for:

- Recency: How recently a customer made their last purchase.

- Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases within a certain period.

- Monetary: How much money a customer spends on purchases.

The purpose of RFM is to segment customers into categories based on their behavior.

 ## Business Conclusion
Spending per Product Category
Based on Median:

1. Wines (174.5) is the category with the highest spending, indicating large transaction values or regular purchases.
2. Meat Products (67.0) rank second, highlighting their importance in shopping patterns.
3. Gold Products (24.0) play a moderate role, possibly high in value but purchased less frequently.
4. Fish (12.0), Fruits (8.0), and Sweet Products (8.0) have low median spending, likely due to lower prices or less frequent purchases.

Customer Segments (RFM):

1. Champions: Best customers; recent, frequent, and high-value buyers. Their loyalty needs to be maintained.
2. Loyal Customers: Frequent and high-value buyers, though not very recent. Worth keeping and appreciating.
3. At Risk: Previously active but now becoming inactive. Requires approaches to prevent loss.
4. Hibernating: Infrequent and haven‚Äôt purchased for a long time. Can be targeted with reactivation campaigns.
5. New Customers: Recently made purchases but not yet regular. Need education and encouragement for repeat buying.
6. Lost Customers: Have been inactive for a very long time. Low potential, can be given low priority.
7. Potential Loyal Customers: Customers showing signs of increased engagement and purchase frequency. With proper nurturing, they can become loyal buyers.

Campaign Effectiveness:

Out of the total customers, 568 people (27.65%) responded to the campaign (responded to at least one campaign), while 1,486 people (72.35%) did not respond at all.
Although the non-responding group is larger, they actually generated a higher total expenditure amounting to 681,283, compared to the group that received the campaign, which only generated 564,358.

Recency (Last Campaign) vs Response:

Customers who responded to the campaign tended to be more recent (interacted more recently) ‚Äî as indicated by their lower recency values. On the other hand, those who did not respond to the campaign had not made transactions for a longer period (higher recency values).
